## Overview
A menu is a set of options presented to the user of a computer application to help the user find information or execute a function.

## Usage
Menu is used when the user is to be provided with the ability to select from a list of options without consuming the GUI layout.

### How to use

1. Drag and drop the “Menu” component from the “Navigation” section.
2. Set the “matMenu” attribute to a string value.
3. Drag and drop the “Menu Item” component(s) inside the “Menu” component.
4. Set the “MenuItemName” of “Menu Item” component to a string value.
5. Drag and drop the “Menu Button” component to the desired position and set “MenuName” attribute.
6. Set the “[matMenuTriggerFor]” attribute to the same value as the “matMenu” of the “Menu” component.

### Example

1. Create a page called “page”.
2. Drag and drop the “Menu” component.
3. Set the “matMenu” attribute as “menu”.
4. Drag and drop 3 “Menu Item” components inside the “Menu” component.
5. Set the “MenuItemName” as “item1”, “item2” and “item3” respectively.
6. Drag and drop the “Menu Button” component to the desired position and set “MenuName” attribute as “Menu” and “[matMenuTriggerFor]” attribute to “menu”.
 7. Now, when the “Menu” button is clicked, it will reveal the list of menu items (“item1”, “item2”, “item3”).
