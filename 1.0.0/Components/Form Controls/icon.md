## Overview: 
The Icon component represents an icon in the application. Icons are most effective when they improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.

## Usage
Icons are used when we need to improve visual interest and grab the user's attention. They help guide users while they're navigating a page.

### How to use:   
- Drag and drop the component. 
- Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.

### Example: 
Input the component field with the attribute value:
``` 
iconname = home
class = icon
