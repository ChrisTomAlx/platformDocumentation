## Overview 
Checkbox are rendered by default as square boxes that are checked (ticked) when activated. They allow you to select single values for submission in a form (or not).

**Note:** Radio buttons are similar to checkboxes, but with an important distinction â€” radio buttons are grouped into a set in which only one radio button can be selected at a time, whereas checkboxes allow you to turn single values on and off. Where multiple controls exist, radio buttons allow one to be selected out of them all, whereas checkboxes allow multiple values to be selected.

## Usage
Checkbox component allows the users to select any combination of options in a group of check boxes. A group of check boxes is used for independent choices. A group of check boxes can also be used to select from a set of one or more choices.

### How to use   
- Drag and drop the component. 
- Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
- Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

### Example 
Input the component field with the attribute value:
``` 
Checked = true
Id = check
```
