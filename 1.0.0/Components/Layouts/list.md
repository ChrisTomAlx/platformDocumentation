- Drag and drop a list-items component inside the list-component. And for the list-items set the attribute such as style, class, *ngFor and label.
-   *ngFor is used to iterate through the object and access the items of the objects, so if folders is a object which has attribute as name(name of folder) which is a string, and there are three items in the folder object. So set the field in ngFor as 
let folder of folders .
4 Label attribute give the name which will be displayed as a list items, so provide the name as (folder .name), this will access the folders object and get the name value from that.
